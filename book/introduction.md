# Introduction

## Setup

***If you do not know how to use `PowerShell` on Windows, `Terminal` on macOS or `bash` on Linux then you need to go learn that first.***

To get started with this book you will need a few things:

- a text editor *(a very simple one, like [Atom](https://atom.io/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), just to edit files)*
- GHC â€” the *Glasgow Haskell Compiler*. Follow the instruction for your platform to install it.
  - [Windows](https://www.haskell.org/platform/windows.html)
  - [macOS](https://www.haskell.org/platform/mac.html)
  - [Linux](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/linux/)
