# Chapter 1

## GHCI

In this chapter we are not going to use the text editor to write programs, but we are going to use the interactive mode of `ghc`. To use it type `ghci` in the terminal; you should see something like this:

```console
$ ghci
GHCi, version 8.8.3: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude> 
```

The prompt here is `Prelude>` but for simplicity we're going to use `位>`.

To *exit* from `ghci` just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>.



## What is data?

Programming is just manipulating data. You get input and you return an output.

There multiple kinds of data (called *data types*), like for example:

- numbers: `69`, `420.0`, `3.1415`, `1024`, *...*
- characters: `'h'`, `'e'`, `'l'`, `'l'`, `'o'`, *...*
- boolean values: `True`, `False`
- lists of things: `[1, 2, 3]`, `['n', 'o']`, `[0.1, 0.2, 0.4]`, *...*
- *...*

In ghci, to see to which *data type* something belongs, just type `:t` before it

```console
位> :t 1
1 :: Num p => p
位> :t 5.0
5.0 :: Fractional p => p
:t ['y', 'o']
['y', 'o'] :: [Char]
位> :t True
True :: Bool
```

We see that the double colon (`::`) separates the *expression* that we just wrote from the *type* that *ghci* says it is.

As we saw *ghci* tells us that:

- `1` is a `Num`, which means that it is some kind of number
- `5.0` is a `Fractional`, which means that it's some kind of fractional number *(a number with a decimal part)*
- `['y', 'o']` is a `[Char]`: a list of characters
- `True` is a `Bool`, or a boolean value



***Exercise:*** *Try to play and try what* ghci *will spit if you enter other values*
